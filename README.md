# crud

This project aims to share code details on the design of a crud (create, update, delete) in javascript. 

This project allowed me to focus on objects.

I use two info fields and a button to submit this info once the submit button clicks, this info will be stored in a div [which I use as an array].Each piece of information can then be deleted or modified.
