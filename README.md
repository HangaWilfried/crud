# crud

This project aims to share code details on the design of a crud (create, update, delete) in javascript. 

This project allowed me to focus on objects.

I use two info fields and a button to submit this info once the submit button clicks, this info will be stored in a div [which I use as an array].Each piece of information can then be deleted or modified.

TECHNOLOGIES:

HTML
CSS
JAVASCRIPT && LOCALSTORAGE

HTML to describe the structure of my work. to get an idea to what i wish to expect.

CSS to make a design into my HTML file

JAVASCRIPT to add dynamically some informations in who are typed in inputs tags.Use to manage events and bind actions into my html file.

LOCALSTORAGE instead of use a BAckend Technology i used this in the place. it help me to save the informations when any modifications occurs.
